# DomoWatch
===

The final goal of this project is to controle my smart home automation using TTGO TWatch.

In addition, the code has been made in **POO way** and being **very modular** (and commented as well) : should be a good starting point for new projects.

---

This code is inspirated from examples comming with TTGO_TWatch_Library made by Lewis He.
